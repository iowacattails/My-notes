<h1>Jury of the Vicinage (Neighborhood)</h1>

<p><strong>Opening Statement:</strong> Under the new plan, persons accused may be carried from one extremity of the state to another and tried, not by an impartial jury of the vicinage acquainted with his character and the circumstances of the fact, but by a jury unacquainted with both, and who may be biased against him. This is sufficient to alarm men.</p>

<h2>Main Argument – Patrick Henry, Virginia Ratifying Convention</h2>
<p>How different is this from the immemorial practice of your British ancestors, and your own? By the common law a number of hundredors were required on a jury, and afterwards it was sufficient if the jurors came from the same county. With less than this, the people of England have never been satisfied. That paper ought to have declared the common law in force.</p>

<p>No neighbors who are acquainted with their characters, their good or bad conduct in life, to judge of the unfortunate man who may be thus exposed to the rigor of that government.</p>
