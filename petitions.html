    <h1>Petitions</h1>

    <blockquote>
        […In every stage of these oppressions we have petitioned for redress in the most humble terms; our repeated petitions have been answered only by repeated injury…]
        <cite>Declaration of Independence, 1776</cite>
    </blockquote>

    <h2>Article IV sec. IV</h2>
    <p>The United States shall guarantee to every State in this Union a Republican Form of Government, and shall protect each of them against Invasion; and on Application of the Legislature, OR OF THE EXECUTIVE (when the Legislature cannot be convened) [ or when they deny you the RIGHT to petition..or ignore your petitions ] against domestic Violence. [which is internal insurrection… invasion from within, treason, emolument violations]</p>

    <h2>Article the third...</h2>
    <p>Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to PETITION the Government for a redress of grievances.</p>
    <cite>Bill of Rights 1789</cite>

    <blockquote>
        “Another reason why no action should be taken by the Legislative Assembly, and which leads me to believe that no good cause exists for its repeal, is the fact that NO PETITIONS HAVE BEEN PRESENTED upon the subject, which could not have been the case if desired by the people, as it is a subject in which every person has a vital interest.“
        <cite>Journals of the Council and House of Representatives of the Fourth Session- Idaho, 1867</cite>
    </blockquote>

    <p>The Right to petition the legislature is a common law fundamental right secured by the Magna Charta Chpt 61- 1215, and the English Bill of Rights- 1689</p>
    <blockquote>
        "That it is the right of the subjects to petition the king, and all commitments and prosecutions for such petitioning are illegal".

    <p>1074. It is with respect to measures of a public character, that the right of petition has been deemed the most sacred, and has been guarded with the most care; as it is by this means only that constituents can express their opinion upon great national questions, and bring their opinions to bear directly upon the legislative power. Petitions of this description do not rest upon the testimony of witnesses for their facts; nor do they trust to the ability and eloquence of counsel for their arguments and illustrations. They are simply to be regarded as expressing the deliberate convictions of the petitoners, upon facts which are notorious or accessible to all, and founded in arguments and considerations which appeal to the reason and judgment of all. 1075. The legitimate effect, therefore, of their representations, depends upon two considerations, namely, the influence which popular opinion is entitled to have upon the acts of government, and upon the facts and arguments which petitioners bring forward in support of their opinions.</p>

    <p>Pg.435-436</p>
    <p>In a petition, the statements of the petitioners are received as the ground of the prayer which they make. A memorial which is similar in its statements and allegations to a petition, but is unaccompanied by a prayer, is said to be objectionable in point of form, because it assumes to speak as an equal and to advise the legislature as to its duties, without any particular object in view ; but such papers have nevertheless been received as petitions, when there was no other objection to them, but in point of form, and they contain language equivalent to a prayer. A remonstrance, which may be regarded as a similar representation, unaccompanied by a prayer, and intended to express opposition to the passing of some act, or the adoption of some pending or contemplated measure, is equally objectionable in point of form, and for the same reasons. Papers with this title, when drawn up in respectful language, and amounting substantially to a petition against some proposed or pending measure, have been received as petitions. But, in general, it appears to be the usage, especially when the object is to call in question the proceedings of the house, to reject papers of this description. A. protest is similar in character to a remonstrance, but expressed in stronger language. A declaration against any measure does not seem to be different from a protest or remonstrance. Papers bearing any of these tities, if they contain a prayer, are received as petitions. It may be observed in general, that the objections to remonstrances, protests, etc, are, for the most part, merely formal. The same statements, which they contain, may be put into the form of petitions, and are then receivable. A paper expressing approbation of the proceedings of the house is equally objectionable with a protest or remonstrance, and is not receivable, unless it bears the form of a petition</p>

    <h2>Bouvier's Law Dictionary</h2>
    <p>Pg.  2578-2579</p>
    <p>PETITION. An instrument of writing or printing, containing a prayer from the person presenting it, called the petitioner, to the body or person to whom it is presented, for the redress of some wrong or the grant of some favor which the latter has the right to give.</p>
    <p>By the constitution of the United States, the right “to petition the government for a redress of grievances” is secured to the people. Amend, art. 1. See Constitution of United States. Petitions are frequently presented to the courts in order to bring some matters before them. It is a general rule in such cases that an affidavit should be made that the facts therein contained are true as far as known to the petitioner, and that those facts which he states on information he believes to be true. It is said that the sufficiency of a petition must be determined by its face, and can neither be aided nor destroyed by the accompanying exhibits, the exhibits being no part of it; Merrill v. Trust Co., 46 Mo. App. 236.</p>
