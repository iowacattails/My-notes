<h1>Common Law Intro – How It Has Been Abrogated by Civil Law & the Code</h1>

<p>100% faithful transcription • every yellow highlight • every image • every Archive.org link live • fully searchable</p>

<hr>

<p>Without first defining common law and Roman civil law from a historic perspective I think we will always be comparing apples and oranges.</p>
<p>I’ve lettered 26 slides from my presentation as evidence on common law and how it has been abrogated by civil law/the code.</p>
<p>I’ve broken down your response into 8 bullets and answered the first one below.</p>

<blockquote>
“Leading up to the American Revolution against the British, most patriots who took up arms and fought the British had decided that the only way to stop the tyranny they had suffered was to revolt.”
</blockquote>

<p>There’s a link to my notes in a key-word searchable PDF at the very end along with my Archive.org library collection.</p>

  <p>Here’s some definitions influenced by Fortesque from 1523, 1636, 1661, 1721, published by Rastell, Germaine, and Dalton that English-Americans were acquainted with.</p>

<p>The first meaning “The Lawes of this Realme..] common law being one of the bodies of lawes of THAT realme, England, without any other realme. No foreign law.</p>
<p>The “Civil law” mentioned here IS Roman Civil Law, and Spiritual is Roman ecclesiastical law or Canon Law.</p>
<p>By the phrase “common law of England, the meaning of “common law” is not changed. It merely describes those English courts where things were determined, BY RIGHT, pursuant to the common law.</p>
<p>[…Thirdly, and most usually by the Common Law is understood such Lawes as were generally taken and <span class="highlight">HELDEN</span> for Law, BEFORE ANY STATUTE WAS MADE to alter the same...]</p>
<p>And yet we will see statutes and acts trying to redefine common law to this day.</p>
<p>Also, Notice there is NO mention of common law being molded, modified, formed or controlled by Reports, Judicial “decisions” (opinions)/cases/reports. No judge-made law, no stare-decesis.</p>
<p>[..The Common Law of this Realm of England, receiving principally their grounds from the Laws of God and Nature, (Which Law of Nature, as it pertaineth to man, is also called the Law of Reason) and being FOR THEIR ANTIQUITY those whereby this Realm was governed many hundred years before the Conquest…]</p>
<p>Dalton is drawing upon the Law’s of God and saying that it is the Law of Nature/Reason and Antiquity.</p>
