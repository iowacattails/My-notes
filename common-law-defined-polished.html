    <h1>Common Law Defined — Polished & Hyperlinked</h1>

    <p><strong>“American patriots fought for the rights of Englishmen… and for the rights of man as they understood them to be guaranteed by Nature and Nature’s God.”</strong><br>
    <cite>The Spirit of ‘Seventy-Six, p. viii</cite></p>

    <p>The common law of England — rooted in the laws of God, antiquity, reason, and Nature’s God — was the foundation colonists carried to America.</p>

    <h2>True Historical Definition (1527–1776)</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>John Rastell (1527): Common law = law of England alone, pre-statutory, unchanged by Parliament</li>
        <li>Michael Dalton (1661): “receiving principally their grounds from the Laws of God and Nature…”</li>
        <li>Sir Edward Coke (1642): Magna Carta declared “the Great Charter as the Common Law” — binding on all judges forever</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Rejection of Roman Civil Law</h2>
    <p>George Leapingwell (1859): Civil law never adopted in England — King Stephen banned its study<br>

    <h2>“Stare Decisis” — A 19th-Century Fiction</h2>
    <p>No 17th/18th-century writer uses the phrase. Coined ~1820s to give judge-made law the appearance of antiquity.</p>

    <h2>Infiltration Timeline</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1571 — First civil-law procedure allowed in privileged courts</li>
        <li>1848 — David Dudley Field’s “Field Code” spreads Roman code-pleading across U.S.</li>
        <li>1873 — Judicature Act fuses law & equity in England — common-law supremacy ends</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>The common law the Founders knew was fixed, God-given, tied to Magna Carta — never judge-made, never statute-altered. Its deliberate corruption by civil-law codes and “stare decisis” mythology is one of history’s greatest deceptions.</p>
