    <p><strong>“American patriots fought for the rights of Englishmen… and for the rights of man as they understood them to be guaranteed by Nature and Nature’s God.”</strong><br>
    <cite>The Spirit of ‘Seventy-Six, p. viii</cite></p>

    <p>The common law of England — rooted in the laws of God, antiquity, and reason — formed the foundation of the rights the colonists carried to America.</p>
