    <p>The common law of England: “American patriots fought for the rights of Englishmen, as they believed them to be guaranteed by the British Constitution, and for the rights of man as they understood them to be guaranteed by Nature and Nature's God.” The spirit of 'seventy-six ( book pg viii)<br>
    The common law of England, a system rooted in the laws of God, God’s Laws of Nature, antiquity, and reason, formed the foundation of the rights that English colonists brought to America.<br>
    Defined by scholars and philosophers—such as Sir John Fortescue, John Rastell, Edward Coke, Richard Hooker, Michael Dalton, Hugo Grotius, John Selden, John Hampden, John Milton, James Harrington, Algernon Sidney, Samuel von Pufendorf, John Locke, Montesquieu, and Emer de Vattel.<br>
    Drawing on natural law and the law of nations, these scholars strengthened the common law’s basis in right reason, affirming its role as a guardian of rights and customs."</p>

    <p>Historical Context: Defining the Common Law<br>
    The common law of England, as understood by English-Americans, was a distinct body of law, separate from foreign systems like Roman civil law or ecclesiastical canon law. John Rastell’s Les Termes de la Ley (originally written 1527) (book Pg.72, digital Pg. 162) articulates this clarity: “The Lawes of this Realme..], common law being one of the bodies of lawes of THAT realme, England, without any other realme” This definition, echoed in the 1721 edition, (Pg. 147 ) emphasizes its exclusivity: “Thirdly, and most usually by the Common Law is understood such Lawes as were generally taken and HELDEN for Law, BEFORE ANY STATUTE WAS MADE to alter the same”. Michael Dalton’s The Countrey Justice (1661) (book Pg. 1, digital Pg. 11) further roots it in divine and natural origins: “The Common Law of this Realm of England, receiving principally their grounds from the Laws of God and Nature… being FOR THEIR ANTIQUITY those whereby this Realm was governed many hundred years before the Conquest” .<br>
    These texts, influenced by Fortescue’s earlier works ( late 15th cen.), establish the common law as a pre-statutory, unburdened by stare decisis or judicial innovation, judge-independent system, and free of Roman civil law’s sway.<br>
    A Manual of the Roman Civil Law Arranged After the Analysis of Dr. Hallifax : George Leapingwell-1859 ( book page 19) […the Civil law was never directly adopted in any of its parts as the law of England, its indirect influence has been very great. The divisions of the ''year-books" (the early law reports), all shew how much they were influenced by the Civil law. All the early chancellors were ecclesiastics, and they drew largely from the Corpus Juris..]</p>

    <p>The Roots of liberty : Magna Carta, ancient constitution, and the Anglo-American tradition of rule of law<br>
    (Pg. 12 ) […As to why some kings of England nonetheless sought to change the laws and introduce the Roman civil law, Fortescue again quotes lex regia (Institutes 1.2.6.; Digest 1. 4.1) in explanation: "What pleased the prince has the force of law” [Quod principi placuit legis habet vigorem]..]</p>

    <p>"Stare decisis," or stare decisis et non quieta movere—"You have decided to stand still and not move"—has no basis in common law. It is a phony maxim, phrased in Latin in the 19th century to evoke the appearance of antiquity, but it is nothing more than "judge-made law." I have found no specific 17th- or 18th-century document using the phrase "stare decisis." The evidence suggests the phrase was coined and gained prominence in the early 19th century, with Kent's Commentaries (1826–1830) being a key early reference, as cited in Bouvier's Law Dictionary. The absence of the phrase in key 18th-century texts, such as Blackstone’s, indicates it was not part of legal discourse during that period.</p>

    <p>The Bar has stacked bad opinions upon bad opinions, using Roman Civil Law, the "Code," and a monopoly on assistance of counsel, creating fallible doctrines that evolve from "legal fictions" and counterfeit maxims of equity. "Leading cases" and "law of the case" have transformed into "case-law" and "American common law."</p>

    <p>Judge Bracton (Romanist) 1245-1267 A concise history of the common law-1929, Plucknett (pg 180-181) [..First of all, besides studying the form of the original writs, he also introduced complete transcripts of the pleadings in selected cases. This great innovation gives to his work in several places a curiously modern air, for like modern law writers he sometimes praises and sometimes criticizes his cases. At the beginning of his book he explains, however, that the contemporary bench is not distinguished by ability or learning, and that his treatise is, to some extent, a protest against modern tendencies..] [...He never gives us any discussion of the authority of cases and clearly would not understand the modern implications of stare decisis. Indeed, his cases are carefully selected because they illustrate what he believes the law ought to be, and not because they have any binding authority; he freely admits that at the present moment decisions are apt to be on different lines. Bracton’s use of cases, therefore, is not based upon their authority as sources of law, but upon his personal respect for the judges who decided them, and his belief that they raise and discuss questions upon lines which he considers sound..]</p>

    <p>The History of the common law of England-1716,Sir Matthew Hale. […Judicial Decisions. It is true, the Decisions of Courts of Justice, tho' by Virtue of the Law of this Realm they do bind as a Law between the Parties thereto, as to the particular Case in Question, till revers'd by Error or Attaint, yet they do not make a Law properly so called...]</p>

    <p>THE LAW OF THE CASE-Harvard Law Review, 1909 ( pg. 438) [..For orderly procedure inferior courts must be bound by the decision of their supreme court in the particular case. But the situation becomes somewhat startling when the supreme court applies the rule to itself and refuses on subsequent appeal to correct its former mistakes..]</p>

    <p>The American law register, 1852. (book page 235) […But it is demanded of us that we shall follow the decision in Weidman v. Maish , where this very devise has received a construction. And why must we follow it? If the law was totally misapplied in that case, when one forty-fourth part of this land was in controversy, must we therefore continue to misapply it as often as the other shares come up for discussion? Because we or our predecessors have wronged one man by our blunders, must we therefore wrong forty-three others for the sake of our own consistency? If not thus, then on what principle can we do it? Not simply because this very devise has been decided on: most clearly not. This would be presenting the doctrine of former recovery in a new aspect. One verdict and judgment are not conclusive even in the very same interest, and between the very same parties; whereas this would make one verdict and judgment, as to one interest and one set of parties, conclusive as to all similar interests and as to other parties, even though not heard. Does the doctrine of stare decisis hold us to conform to that decision ? trust that the doctrine shall never be held to mean, that the last decision of a point is to be taken as the law of all future cases, right or wrong. Then, indeed, will the isolated blunders of this Court be of far more force than an Act of Assembly or a clause of the Constitution, for they may invade the inviolability of contracts. This is certainly a new phase of the doctrine of stare decisis , that is most suicidal in its results. It is setting aside the old doctrine, and establishing a new one. It is a declaration that all courts of the last resort must have been in error every time they have acknowledged and set aside former errors, which has not been an unfrequent event. Nay, more; it is claiming for this Court an infallability that can have no result but the perpetuation of the most incompatible errors.</p>

    <p>Chancellor Kent: (Com. Lect. 21,). […I wish not to be understood to press too strongly the doctrine of stare decisis, when I recollect that there are a thousand cases to be pointed out in the English and American books of reports which have been overruled, doubted, or limited in their application. It is probable that the records of many of the courts in this country are replete with hasty and crude decisions; and such cases ought to be examined without fear, and revised without reluctance, rather than have the character of our law impaired, and the beauty and harmony of the system destroyed by the perpetuity of error. Even a series of decisions is not always conclusive evidence of what is law, and the revision of a decision very often resolves itself into a mere question of expediency, depending upon the consideration of the importance of certainty in the rule, and the extent of property to be effected by a change of it.”</p>

    <p>Ancient law, its connection with the early history of society, and its relation to modern ideas -1861 Henry James Sumner Maine-Legal Fictions/Case-Law (excerpts from book page 29-32) […It would be easy to select from almost any regularly developed body of rules examples of legal fictions, which at once betray their true character to the modern observer. In the two instances which I proceed to consider, the nature of the expedient employed is not so readily detected. The first author's of these fictions did not perhaps intend to innovate, certainly did not wish to be suspected of innovating. There are, moreover, and always have been, persons who refuse to see any fiction in the process, and conventional language bears out their refusal. No examples, therefore, can be better calculated to illustrate the wide diffusion of legal fictions, and the efficiency with which they perform their two-fold office of transforming a system of laws and of concealing the transformation.] [..With respect to that great portion of our legal system which is enshrined in cases and recorded in law reports, we habitually employ a double language, and entertain, as it would appear, a double and inconsistent set of ideas. When a group of facts come before an English Court for adjudication, the whole course of the discussion between the judge and the advocate assumes that no question is, or can be, raised which will call for the application of any principles but old ones, or of any distinctions but such as have long since been allowed. It is taken absolutely for granted that there is somewhere a rule of known law which will cover the facts of the dispute now litigated, and that, if such a rule be not discovered, it is only that the necessary patience, knowledge or acumen, is not forthcoming to detect it. Yet the moment the judgment has been rendered and reported, we slide unconsciously or unavowedly into a new language and a new train of thought. We now admit that the new decision has modified the law. The rules applicable have, to use the very inaccurate expression sometimes employed, become more elastic. In fact they have been changed. A clear addition has been made to the precedents, and the canon of law elicited by comparing the precedents is not the same with that which would have been obtained if the series of cases had been curtailed by a single example…] [..The fact that the old rule has been repealed, and that a new one has replaced it, eludes us, because we are not in the habit of throwing into precise language the legal formulas which we derive from the precedents, so that a change in their tenor is not easily detected unless it is violent and glaring…][..and yet we maintain that the rules of the English common law, with some assistance from the Court of Chancery and from Parliament, are coextensive with the complicated interests of modern society. A body of law bearing a very close and very instructive resemblance to our case-law in those particulars which I have noticed, was known to the Romans under the name of the Responsa Prudentum, the " answers of the learned in the law."..]</p>

[..It happened, therefore, by a somewhat singular conjunction of circumstances, that to the Roman laws brought over to England by Monks, the idea of Ecclesiastical power became associated, in the same manner as the idea of Despotism was afterwards associated with the Religion of the same Monks, when favoured by Kings who endeavoured to establish a despotic government. The Nobility, at all times, rejected these laws, even with a degree of ill humour; (a) and the usurper Stephen, (Pg. 105) ...whose interest it was to conciliate their affections, went so far as to prohibit the study of them. The general disposition of things establishing, as we have seen, a great communication between the Nobility and the People, the aversion to the Roman laws gradually spread itself far and wide..][..Roger Vacarius (1120-1200?) was an Italian authority in civil and canon law who was known to author the Liber pauperum which between the years 1190-1220 influenced the development of legal studies in the University of Oxford. According to Gervase of Canterbury, Vacarius became the first known teacher of Roman law in England.</p>

The English lawyers of that period were much opposed to the Civil law, so they contended that it was hostile to the liberties of England..] [..The Norman nobility were hostile to it; and King Stephen, who was completely in the power of his barons, issued an order against the study of it, and altogether prohibited it..]</p>

(book page 102) Each of the universities had several powers and privileges by charters from the kings of this realm, particularly one in the eighth of Hen. 4, whereby they were authorized to hold plea of all causes arising within the university according to the course of the civil law: but in the opinion of all the judges of England the grant was held not to be good; for that the king could not by his grant alter the law of the land..] [..By letters patent (not confirmed by parliament) dated thirtieth March, 11 Car. 1, granted to the University of Oxford, their old privileges are explained, and larger granted. 1 Mod. 161, Magdalen College case; Wood's Inst. 518..] [..Their courts are called the Chancellors' Courts. The chancellors are usually peers of the realm, and appointed over the whole university.

    <p>Edward Livingston the NY Codifier and opportunist, abrogating the “7th amendment” on 10th of April, 1805, Louisiana applying it only to “appellate proceedings in the Federal courts”</p>

    <p>Life of Edward Livingston-1864, Charles Hunt (book page 116) [..The recent cession of Louisiana, which had brought the territory under the Constitution of the United States, gave rise to a grave question in the courts, whether the clause in that instrument providing for trial by jury, and requiring [ restricting.. not requiring] the reexamination, in the courts of the United States, of any fact so tried to be according to the rules of the common law, had not, at one stroke, imposed upon Louisiana the whole system of English legal practice, unknown and repugnant as it was to a vast majority of her inhabitants. If this question had been decided in the affirmative, of course the lawyers who had emigrated thither from common-law States would have brought their peculiar knowledge to an excellent market ; and not one of them was equally qualified with Livingston to make much of such an advantage. The bar arrayed itself into two parties upon this question, and a cause was made up expressly to obtain a full discussion and judicial settlement of the point. Mr. Livingston was selected as the leading champion of those who contended, that, although the Federal Constitution had brought in the trial by jury, and made obligatory the observance of common-law rules in appellate proceedings in the Federal courts, yet that the courts and people of Louisiana were at liberty, in the main part of legal practice, to follow the ways to which they were accustomed, and even to adopt, if they chose, a system which should be to them more intelligible still. I have not found anything that could be called a report of the argument he delivered on this occasion ; but it produced a profound impression, and was long remembered as a masterpiece of forensic reasoning and eloquence. The decision of the court was in accordance with the ground taken by Livingston. Following up this success, he recommended a simplification of the existing practice, which was a medley of the civil and Spanish law. The suggestion was accepted, and the task of drawing up a new code of procedure was committed to his hands. He performed the work promptly ; and when he had been in Louisiana but little above a year, the legislature adopted an entire system of practice proposed and framed by him. It is embodied in an act, passed on the 10th of April, 1805, consisting of twenty-two sections, and extending only to twenty-five printed pages…]<br>

One respecting the jurisdiction of the Courts, especially of the Supreme Court upon appeal, which, if adopted by the Legislature and approved by the Supreme Court, will, we think, give relief upon appeal in a large class of cases affecting property, where that remedy is not now allowed. We have endeavored to render the laws for selecting jurors more efficient, and to discard the rule which often disqualified the most intelligent persons drawn as jurors, because they had expressed an opinion upon merely outside rumors. We have proposed to dispense with the verification of pleadings in those cases where, if required, there is always an oath on one side and an opposing oath on the other, leading to great corruption and demoralization. We have endeavored to simplify and expedite the procedure on moving for new trials; to dispense with special findings by the Courts in cases where they are not needed; to render the rules of evidence clearer and more precise; to purge definitions from all redundancy; to restore to the clauses regulating redemption from sales under judgment, some material provisions which had been left out by accident, and to remedy some defects in them which have only lately been discovered; and to make the provisions regulating actions against steamers and boats for the first time constitutional under the decisions of the Supreme Court..</p>

The result, of course, fell considerably short of a complete fusion of law and equity, which was not carried out till the reforms of Justinian. The technical severance of the two elements of jurisprudence entailed some confusion and some inconvenience, and there were certain of the stubborner doctrines of the Civil Law with which neither the authors nor the expositors of the Edict had ventured to interfere. But at the same time there was no corner of the field of jurisprudence which was not more or less swept over by the influence of Equity. It supplied the jurist with all his materials for generalisation, with all his methods of interpretation, with his elucidations of first principles, and with that great mass of limiting rules which are rarely interfered with by the legislator, but which seriously controlled the application of every legislative act..]</p>

    <p>This ancient framework found its anchor in Magna Carta 1215, reaffirmed as common law by the Confirmation of the Charters (Confirmatio Cartarum)—1297<br>
    The Second Part of the Institutes of the Laws of England-Edward Coke (digital page 126)<br>
    […EDWARD, by the grace of God, king of England, lord of Ireland, and duke of Guian, to all those that these present letters shall hear or see, greeting. Know ye that we, to the honour of God and of holy church, and to the profit of our realm, have granted for us and our heirs, that the charter of liberties, and the charter of the forest, which were made by common assent of all the realm, in the time of king Henry, our father, shall be kept in every point without breach.And we will that the same charters shall be sent under our seal, as well to our justices of the forest, as to others, and to all sheriffs of shires, and to all our other officers, and to all our cities throughout the realm, together with our writs, in the which it shall be contained, that they cause the foresaid charters to be published, and to declare to the people that we have confirmed them in all points; and that our justices, sheriffs, mayors, and other ministers, which under us have the laws of our land to guide, shall allow the said charters pleaded before them in judgement in all their points, that is to wit, THE GREAT CHARTER AS THE COMMON LAW, and the charter of the forest, for the wealth of our realm…]<br>
    (digital page 163-164) […This is a clause worthy to be written in letters of gold: that our judges, sheriffs, mayors, and other ministers, who under us have the laws of our land to guide them, shall allow the said charters in all their points, which in any plea shall come before them in judgment. And here it is to be observed that the laws are the judges’ guides or leaders, according to that old rule: Lex est exercitus judicum tutissimus dux (The law is the safest leader of the army of judges), or lex est optimus judicis pedagogus (The law is the best guide of the judge), and lex est tutissima cassis (The law is the safest helmet). There is an old legal word, called guidagium, which signifies an office of guiding travelers through dangerous and unknown ways. Here it appears that the laws of the realm have this office to guide the judges in all causes that come before them in the ways of right justice, which never yet misguided any man who certainly knew them and truly followed them. The great charter, as common law, and the charter of the forest, in amendment of our realm: The sense hereof is that the Great Charter and the Charter of the Forest are to be held as the common law, that is, the law common to all; and that both charters are in amendment of the realm, that is, to amend great mischiefs and inconveniences which oppressed the whole realm before the making of them..]</p>

    <p>Idaho’s “Code” 1919 compilation (book Pg. 2605) ironically acknowledges Magna Carta’s foundational role in the same book that abrogates its principles with their Civil law “code”</p>

    <p>1774 Declaration ( book Pg. 69) “the respective colonies are entitled to the common law of England, and more especially to the great and inestimable privilege of being tried by their peers of the vicinage, according to the course of THAT law”..]<br>
    […That they are ENTITLED to the benefit of such of the English statutes, AS EXISTED AT THE TIME OF THEIR COLONIZATION ; and which they have, by experience, respectively found to be applicable to their several local and other circumstances…]</p>

    <p>This entitlement was not to a vague or evolving concept but to the common law as it stood at colonization, untainted by later statutes or foreign law.</p>

    <p>This principle had been perverted in modern contexts like in Idaho laws of the territory, 1863 ( Pg. 527)<br>
    [..Section 1. The common law of England so far as the same is not inconsistent with the provisions of the constitution and laws of the United States, the organic act and laws of this territory, be the law of the land in this territory…]</p>

    <p>They falsely claim that the common law itself, not the specified English statutes, was deemed repugnant.<br>
    They claim we’re only entitled to the fragments of common law that they haven’t stripped away by non-republican Constitutional amendments and subversive “statutes”.</p>

    <p>They are subversively altering the”Law of the land” to mean something other than “[..such of the English statutes as existed at the time of their colonization; and which they have, by experience, respectively found to be applicable to their several local and other circumstances..]</p>

    <p>And in the Michigan constitution 1850- (book page 1012) […That no inconvenience may arise from the changes in the constitution of this State, and in order to carry the same into complete operation, it is hereby declared that—Section 1. The common law and the statute laws now in force, not repugnant to this constitution, shall remain in force until they expire by their own limitations or are altered or repealed by the legislature…]</p>

    <p>The common law altered or repealed by the people or the legislature…That no inconvenience may arise?? NO!!! The fundamental law is SACRED. Neither a “Con”-stitution nor a statute/code can alter Natural Law, or the Fundamental Law of the Land</p>

    <p>Law of Nations -Emer de Vattel- limits on legislature- Fundamental Law- Book 1 , Chpt.3, §34<br>
    […This is called the legislative power. The nation may entrust the exercise of it to the prince, or to an assembly ; or to that assembly and the prince jointly; who have then a right to make new laws and to repeal old ones. It is asked whether their power extends to the fundamental laws, whether they may change the constitution of the state? The principles we lave laid down lead us to decide with certainty, that the authority of these legislators DOES NOT EXTEND SO FAR, and that they ought to consider the fundamental laws as SACRED, if the nation has not, in very express terms, given them power to change them. For the constitution of the state ought to possess stability : and since that was first established by the nation, which afterwards entrusted certain persons with the legislative power, the fundamental laws are excepted from their commission. It is visible that the society only intended to make provision for having the state constantly furnished with laws suited to PARTICULAR CONJUNCTURES, and, for that purpose, gave the legislature the power of abrogating the ancient civil and political laws that were NOT FUNDAMENTAL, and of making new ones: but nothing leads us to think that it meant to submit the constitution itself to their will. In short, it is from the constitution that those legislators derive their power: how then can they change it, without destroying the foundation of their own authorıty ?</p>

    <p>Locke's Discourse on Government Part II. cited in :A vindication of the conduct of the House of Representatives of the Province of the Massachusetts-Bay-1762, James Otis (excerpts from book page 17-19) […The legislative, whether placed in one or more, whether it be always in being, or only by intervals, though it be the supreme power in every commonwealth, yet in the utmost bounds of it, it is limited to the public good of the society. It is a power that hath no end but preservation; and those can never have a right to destroy, enslave, or designedly to impoverish the subjects. These are the bounds to which the trust that is in them, by the society, and the laws of God and nature, have set to the legislative power of every commonwealth, in all forms of government…] [ “Should either the executive or legislative, when they have this power in their hands, design or go about to destroy them, the people have no other remedy in this, as in other cases, when they have no judge upon earth, but to appeal to heaven [rebellion/revolution]. Nor let anyone think that this lays a perpetual foundation for disorder, for this operates not until the inconvenience is so great that the majority feel it, and are weary of it, and find a necessity to have it amended.”..]</p>

    <p>The “course of the common law”, “Due-course”, “Due Process”, “law of the land”</p>

    <p>Early judicial sages, (Pg. 26) cited in Eight Centuries of Reports, affirmed its divine and timeless nature: “The law of God, and the law of the land are all one” (1471)</p>

    <p>Bouvier’s Common Law Dictionary ( Pg. 162) underscores this specificity: defining “At Law” [“…This phrase is used to point out that a thing is to be done according to the course of the common law; it is distinguished from a proceeding in equity..”] [ Equity/Chancery being Roman Civil Law.]<br>
    Furthermore ( book Pg. 826) we know that “The phrase "common law" occurs in the seventh article of the amendments of the constitution of the United States. "In suits at common law, where the value in controversy shall not exceed twenty dollar says that article, "the right of trial by jury shall be preserved. The "common law" HERE MENTIONEDIS THE COMMON LAW OF ENGLAND...]</p>

    <p>The petition of right-1917, Relf (book Pg. 12, digital Pg. 23)<br>
    [.. The first step in the argument was to prove that in the time of Edward III, "law of the land" was interpreted by "due process of law." For this they cited 28 E. Ill, c. 3, which is given in the Petition, showing by comparison with 5 E. Ill, c. 9 and 25 E. Ill, c. 4 that the phrases were used interchangeably. The second step was to prove that "process of law" covered the indictment as well as the trial. Littleton quoted again from 25 E. Ill, c. 4 "that from henceforth none shall be taken . . . unless it be by indictment, or presentment ... or by process made by Writ Original,"' and from 42 E. Ill, c. 3 "that no man be put to answer without presentment . . . or by due process and Writ Original."]</p>

    <p>Statutes cannot alter the fundamental law<br>
    The peoples ancient and just liberties asserted in the tryal of William Penn, ... 1696-William Penn ( book page 56, digital page 62)<br>
    […It is almost incredible to foresee when any maxim or fundamental law of this realm is altered, as demonstrated by the unjust and strange Act of the eleventh year of Henry VII. This Act enabled not only Empson and Dudley themselves but also corrupt Justices of the Peace, whom they authorized, to commit grievous oppressions and exactions. They ground the faces of poor subjects by enforcing penal laws—however obsolete or unfit for the time—through mere information, without presentment or trial by jury, which is the ancient birthright of the subject. Instead, they determined cases at their discretion, imposing penalties as the unrepealed statutes allowed. These and other oppressions and exactions by Empson, Dudley, and their instruments brought immense treasure to the King’s coffers. In the end, the King himself, with great grief and remorse, repented of these actions, as noted elsewhere.</p>

    <p>Conclusion: A Timeless Standard<br>
    The common law of England, as defined from 1527 to 1776 and embraced by colonial Americans, was a fixed, God-given system tied to Magna Carta, never a judge-made or statute-altered construct. Its rejection of Roman civil law and preservation in colonial declarations underscore its role as a bulwark of liberty. From Penn’s defense to the Seventh Amendment, it remains a testament to a legal heritage that prioritizes reason, antiquity, and the rights of Englishmen—unalterable by king or court.</p>
