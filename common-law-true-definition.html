    <h1>Common Law Defined</h1>

    <p><strong>“American patriots fought for the rights of Englishmen… and for the rights of man as they understood them to be guaranteed by Nature and Nature’s God.”</strong><br>
    <cite>The Spirit of ‘Seventy-Six, p. viii</cite></p>

    <p>The common law of England — rooted in the laws of God, antiquity, and reason — formed the foundation of the rights the colonists carried to America.</p>

    <h2>True Definition (1527–1776)</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>John Rastell, <cite>Les Termes de la Ley</cite> (1527): Common law is the law of England alone, pre-statutory, and unchanged by any later act.</li>
        <li>Michael Dalton, <cite>The Countrey Justice</cite> (1661): “receiving principally their grounds from the Laws of God and Nature…”</li>
        <li>Sir Edward Coke, <cite>Second Part of the Institutes</cite> (1642): Magna Carta declared “the common law” and binding on all judges forever.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>The First Roman “Civil Law Procedure” – 1571</h2>
    <blockquote>
        …And therefore in 13 Eliz. an Act passed, whereby that Charter was in effect enacted; and ‘tis thereby that at this Day they have a kind of Civil Law Procedure, even in Matters that are of themselves of Common Law Cognizance, where EITHER of the Parties to the Suit are privileg’d…
    </blockquote>

    <p>Plucknett, <cite>A Concise History of the Common Law</cite> (1929), p. 58:<br>
    A new antagonist appeared in the form of Chancery… The common law courts were indignant when Chancery committed parties for suing at common law after they had been enjoined…</p>

    <p>Sir Matthew Hale (1713), Criminal Cases, p. 50:<br>
    Now as to Matters Criminal… they are determinable by the Common Law, and not otherwise… That no Man shall be put out of his Lands or Tenements, or be imprisoned upon any Suggestion, unless it be by Indictment or Presentment of lawful Men, or by Process at Common Law…</p>

    <p>Halkerston, Latin maxims (p. 5):<br>
    “Admiralitas jurisdictionem non habet super iis quae communi lege dirimuntur.”<br>
    <em>The Admiralty Court has no jurisdiction over those matters which are determined by common law.</em></p>

    <h2>Field Code (1848) → Judicature Act (1873)</h2>
    <p>In 1848 David Dudley Field’s Roman-law “Field Code” spread across America. By 1873 the Judicature Act in England fused law and equity, effectively abrogating the supremacy of common law.</p>

    <blockquote>
        Judicature Act 1873 (p. 35):<br>
        …THE DISTINCTION BETWEEN LAW AND EQUITY HAS THUS BECOME HISTORICAL MERELY…
    </blockquote>

    <p>The arbitrary Roman “Code of Civil Procedure” is the “fusion of common law and equity” — two contradistinctive systems that mix like water and oil. The 7th Amendment, common-law courts, and true due process were quietly erased.</p>

    <h2>The Idaho Example</h2>
    <p>1947 Idaho Code Commission — three Bar members appointed by the Governor — given power to “edit, compile, annotate” the entire Idaho Code.<br>
    <strong>“The Idaho Code is not the law.”</strong> — <cite>Peterson v. Peterson</cite> (2014)</p>

    <h2>The Seventh Amendment’s Ancient Root (1690s Maryland)</h2>
    <p>Unanimous grievance: a Chancellor granting an injunction after a jury verdict of twelve men is “a Grievance… in Derogation of the Common Law.” This is the exact principle behind the 7th Amendment.</p>

    <h2>Law of the Land = Common Law of England</h2>
    <p>Bouvier’s (1856): “The ‘common law’ here mentioned IS THE COMMON LAW OF ENGLAND, and NOT of any particular state.”</p>

    <h2>Legislatures Cannot Touch Fundamental Law</h2>
    <p>Vattel, <cite>Law of Nations</cite>, Book 1, Ch. 3, §34:<br>
    …the authority of these legislators DOES NOT EXTEND SO FAR, and that they ought to consider the fundamental laws as SACRED…</p>

    <h2>Conclusion: A Timeless Standard</h2>
    <p>The common law of England, as defined from 1527 to 1776 and embraced by colonial Americans, was a fixed, God-given system tied to Magna Carta, never a judge-made or statute-altered construct. Its rejection of Roman civil law and preservation in colonial declarations underscore its role as a bulwark of liberty. From Penn’s defense to the Seventh Amendment, it remains a testament to a legal heritage that prioritizes reason, antiquity, and the rights of Englishmen — unalterable by king or court.</p>
