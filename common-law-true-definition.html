    <h1>Common Law of England – The True Definition & Its Corruption</h1>

    <blockquote>
        “American patriots fought for the rights of Englishmen, as they believed them to be guaranteed by the British Constitution, and for the rights of man as they understood them to be guaranteed by Nature and Nature's God.”<br>
        <cite>The Spirit of 'Seventy-Six (book pg viii)</cite>
    </blockquote>

    <p>The common law of England, a system rooted in the laws of God, God’s Laws of Nature, antiquity, and reason, formed the foundation of the rights that English colonists brought to America. Defined by scholars and philosophers—such as Sir John Fortescue, John Rastell, Edward Coke, Richard Hooker, Michael Dalton, Hugo Grotius, John Selden, John Hampden, John Milton, James Harrington, Algernon Sidney, Samuel von Pufendorf, John Locke, Montesquieu, and Emer de Vattel. Drawing on natural law and the law of nations, these scholars strengthened the common law’s basis in right reason, affirming its role as a guardian of rights and customs.</p>

    <h2>Historical Context: Defining the Common Law</h2>
    <p>The common law of England, as understood by English-Americans, was a distinct body of law, separate from foreign systems like Roman civil law or ecclesiastical canon law. John Rastell’s <em>Les Termes de la Ley</em> (originally written 1527) (book Pg.72, digital Pg. 162) articulates this clarity: “The Lawes of this Realme..], common law being one of the bodies of lawes of THAT realme, England, without any other realme” This definition, echoed in the 1721 edition (Pg. 147) emphasizes its exclusivity: “Thirdly, and most usually by the Common Law is understood such Lawes as were generally taken and HELDEN for Law, BEFORE ANY STATUTE WAS MADE to alter the same”. Michael Dalton’s <em>The Countrey Justice</em> (1661) (book Pg. 1, digital Pg. 11) further roots it in divine and natural origins: “The Common Law of this Realm of England, receiving principally their grounds from the Laws of God and Nature… being FOR THEIR ANTIQUITY those whereby this Realm was governed many hundred years before the Conquest”.</p>

    <p>These texts, influenced by Fortescue’s earlier works (late 15th cen.), establish the common law as a pre-statutory, unburdened by stare decisis or judicial innovation, judge-independent system, and free of Roman civil law’s sway.</p>

    <p>George Leapingwell, <em>A Manual of the Roman Civil Law Arranged After the Analysis of Dr. Hallifax</em> (1859) (book page 19):<br>
    […the Civil law was never directly adopted in any of its parts as the law of England, its indirect influence has been very great. The divisions of the ''year-books" (the early law reports), all shew how much they were influenced by the Civil law. All the early chancellors were ecclesiastics, and they drew largely from the Corpus Juris..]</p>

    <p><em>The Roots of Liberty: Magna Carta, Ancient Constitution, and the Anglo-American Tradition of Rule of Law</em> (Pg. 12):<br>
    […As to why some kings of England nonetheless sought to change the laws and introduce the Roman civil law, Fortescue again quotes lex regia (Institutes 1.2.6.; Digest 1. 4.1) in explanation: "What pleased the prince has the force of law” [Quod principi placuit legis habet vigorem]..]</p>

    <h2>“Stare Decisis” – A Phony Maxim</h2>
    <p>"Stare decisis," or stare decisis et non quieta movere—"You have decided to stand still and not move"—has no basis in common law. It is a phony maxim, phrased in Latin in the 19th century to evoke the appearance of antiquity, but it is nothing more than "judge-made law." I have found no specific 17th- or 18th-century document using the phrase "stare decisis." The evidence suggests the phrase was coined and gained prominence in the early 19th century, with Kent's Commentaries (1826–1830) being a key early reference, as cited in Bouvier's Law Dictionary. The absence of the phrase in key 18th-century texts, such as Blackstone’s, indicates it was not part of legal discourse during that period.</p>

    <p>The Bar has stacked bad opinions upon bad opinions, using Roman Civil Law, the "Code," and a monopoly on assistance of counsel, creating fallible doctrines that evolve from "legal fictions" and counterfeit maxims of equity. "Leading cases" and "law of the case" have transformed into "case-law" and "American common law."</p>

    <p>Judge Bracton (Romanist) 1245-1267, <em>A Concise History of the Common Law</em> (1929), Plucknett (pg 180-181):<br>
    [..First of all, besides studying the form of the original writs, he also introduced complete transcripts of the pleadings in selected cases. This great innovation gives to his work in several places a curiously modern air, for like modern law writers he sometimes praises and sometimes criticizes his cases. At the beginning of his book he explains, however, that the contemporary bench is not distinguished by ability or learning, and that his treatise is, to some extent, a protest against modern tendencies..] [...He never gives us any discussion of the authority of cases and clearly would not understand the modern implications of stare decisis. Indeed, his cases are carefully selected because they illustrate what he believes the law ought to be, and not because they have any binding authority; he freely admits that at the present moment decisions are apt to be on different lines. Bracton’s use of cases, therefore, is not based upon their authority as sources of law, but upon his personal respect for the judges who decided them, and his belief that they raise and discuss questions upon lines which he considers sound..]</p>

    <p><em>The Third Part of the Institutes of the Laws of England</em> (1644), Sir Edward Coke (digital page 53):<br>
    [..Secondly, the court ought to be instead counsel for the prisoner, to see that nothing be urged against contrary to law and Right; Nay [or rather], any learned man that is present may inform the court for the benefit of the prisoner, of any thing that may make the proceedings erroneous.]</p>

    <p><em>The History of the Common Law of England</em> (1716), Sir Matthew Hale:<br>
    […Judicial Decisions. It is true, the Decisions of Courts of Justice, tho' by Virtue of the Law of this Realm they do bind as a Law between the Parties thereto, as to the particular Case in Question, till revers'd by Error or Attaint, yet they do not make a Law properly so called...]</p>

    <p><em>The Law of the Case</em>, Harvard Law Review (1909) (pg. 438):<br>
    [..For orderly procedure inferior courts must be bound by the decision of their supreme court in the particular case. But the situation becomes somewhat startling when the supreme court applies the rule to itself and refuses on subsequent appeal to correct its former mistakes..]</p>

    <p><em>The American Law Register</em> (1852) (book page 235):<br>
    […But it is demanded of us that we shall follow the decision in Weidman v. Maish, where this very devise has received a construction. And why must we follow it? If the law was totally misapplied in that case, when one forty-fourth part of this land was in controversy, must we therefore continue to misapply it as often as the other shares come up for discussion? Because we or our predecessors have wronged one man by our blunders, must we therefore wrong forty-three others for the sake of our own consistency? If not thus, then on what principle can we do it? Not simply because this very devise has been decided on: most clearly not. This would be presenting the doctrine of former recovery in a new aspect. One verdict and judgment are not conclusive even in the very same interest, and between the very same parties; whereas this would make one verdict and judgment, as to one interest and one set of parties, conclusive as to all similar interests and as to other parties, even though not heard. Does the doctrine of stare decisis hold us to conform to that decision? I trust that the doctrine shall never be held to mean, that the last decision of a point is to be taken as the law of all future cases, right or wrong. Then, indeed, will the isolated blunders of this Court be of far more force than an Act of Assembly or a clause of the Constitution, for they may invade the inviolability of contracts. This is certainly a new phase of the doctrine of stare decisis, that is most suicidal in its results. It is setting aside the old doctrine, and establishing a new one. It is a declaration that all courts of the last resort must have been in error every time they have acknowledged and set aside former errors, which has not been an unfrequent event. Nay, more; it is claiming for this Court an infallability that can have no result but the perpetuation of the most incompatible errors.]</p>

    <p>Chancellor Kent (Com. Lect. 21):<br>
    […I wish not to be understood to press too strongly the doctrine of stare decisis, when I recollect that there are a thousand cases to be pointed out in the English and American books of reports which have been overruled, doubted, or limited in their application. It is probable that the records of many of the courts in this country are replete with hasty and crude decisions; and such cases ought to be examined without fear, and revised without reluctance, rather than have the character of our law impaired, and the beauty and harmony of the system destroyed by the perpetuity of error. Even a series of decisions is not always conclusive evidence of what is law, and the revision of a decision very often resolves itself into a mere question of expediency, depending upon the consideration of the importance of certainty in the rule, and the extent of property to be effected by a change of it.”]</p>

    <p>Henry James Sumner Maine, <em>Ancient Law, Its Connection with the Early History of Society, and Its Relation to Modern Ideas</em> (1861) (excerpts from book page 29-32):<br>
    […It would be easy to select from almost any regularly developed body of rules examples of legal fictions, which at once betray their true character to the modern observer. In the two instances which I proceed to consider, the nature of the expedient employed is not so readily detected. The first author's of these fictions did not perhaps intend to innovate, certainly did not wish to be suspected of innovating. There are, moreover, and always have been, persons who refuse to see any fiction in the process, and conventional language bears out their refusal. No examples, therefore, can be better calculated to illustrate the wide diffusion of legal fictions, and the efficiency with which they perform their two-fold office of transforming a system of laws and of concealing the transformation.] [..With respect to that great portion of our legal system which is enshrined in cases and recorded in law reports, we habitually employ a double language, and entertain, as it would appear, a double and inconsistent set of ideas. When a group of facts come before an English Court for adjudication, the whole course of the discussion between the judge and the advocate assumes that no question is, or can be, raised which will call for the application of any principles but old ones, or of any distinctions but such as have long since been allowed. It is taken absolutely for granted that there is somewhere a rule of known law which will cover the facts of the dispute now litigated, and that, if such a rule be not discovered, it is only that the necessary patience, knowledge or acumen, is not forthcoming to detect it. Yet the moment the judgment has been rendered and reported, we slide unconsciously or unavowedly into a new language and a new train of thought. We now admit that the new decision has modified the law. The rules applicable have, to use the very inaccurate expression sometimes employed, become more elastic. In fact they have been changed. A clear addition has been made to the precedents, and the canon of law elicited by comparing the precedents is not the same with that which would have been obtained if the series of cases had been curtailed by a single example…] [..The fact that the old rule has been repealed, and that a new one has replaced it, eludes us, because we are not in the habit of throwing into precise language the legal formulas which we derive from the precedents, so that a change in their tenor is not easily detected unless it is violent and glaring…][..and yet we maintain that the rules of the English common law, with some assistance from the Court of Chancery and from Parliament, are coextensive with the complicated interests of modern society. A body of law bearing a very close and very instructive resemblance to our case-law in those particulars which I have noticed, was known to the Romans under the name of the Responsa Prudentum, the " answers of the learned in the law."..]</p>

    […It will hardly be contended that decisions of courts constitute laws. They are at most only evidence of what the laws are, and are not themselves laws. They are often [and often not] re-examined, reversed, and qualifed by the courts themselves, whenever they are found to be either defective, ill-founded or otherwise incorrect..]</p>

    <h2>Rejection of Foreign Law: A Stand Against Civil Law</h2>
    <p>The common law stood in stark contradistinction to equity, admiralty, maritime, and Roman civil law. George Leapingwell’s <em>Manual of the Roman Civil Law</em> (Pg. 19) notes that “the Civil Law is used in Admiralty and ecclesiastical courts”, yet asserts: “in all these THE COMMON LAW has reserved to itself a paramount authority”..</p>

    <p><em>The Constitution of England, or an Account of the English Government</em> (1777), De Lolme (Pg. 104):<br>
    [..It happened, therefore, by a somewhat singular conjunction of circumstances, that to the Roman laws brought over to England by Monks, the idea of Ecclesiastical power became associated, in the same manner as the idea of Despotism was afterwards associated with the Religion of the same Monks, when favoured by Kings who endeavoured to establish a despotic government. The Nobility, at all times, rejected these laws, even with a degree of ill humour; (a) and the usurper Stephen, (Pg. 105) ...whose interest it was to conciliate their affections, went so far as to prohibit the study of them. The general disposition of things establishing, as we have seen, a great communication between the Nobility and the People, the aversion to the Roman laws gradually spread itself far and wide..][..Roger Vacarius (1120-1200?) was an Italian authority in civil and canon law who was known to author the Liber pauperum which between the years 1190-1220 influenced the development of legal studies in the University of Oxford. According to Gervase of Canterbury, Vacarius became the first known teacher of Roman law in England.]</p>

    <p>George Leapingwell, <em>A Manual of the Roman Civil Law Arranged After the Analysis of Dr. Hallifax</em> (1859) (Pg. 18):<br>
    [..With regard to the Civil law in England, it was first introduced by Theobald, a Norman archbishop of Canterbury, who placed Roger Vacarius, a Lombard, at Oxford, to teach it. The English lawyers of that period were much opposed to the Civil law, so they contended that it was hostile to the liberties of England..] [..The Norman nobility were hostile to it; and King Stephen, who was completely in the power of his barons, issued an order against the study of it, and altogether prohibited it..]</p>

    <p>Matthew Bacon, <em>A New Abridgment of the Law</em> (1730) (book page 102):<br>
    Each of the universities had several powers and privileges by charters from the kings of this realm, particularly one in the eighth of Hen. 4, whereby they were authorized to hold plea of all causes arising within the university according to the course of the civil law: but in the opinion of all the judges of England the grant was held not to be good; for that the king could not by his grant alter the law of the land..] [..By letters patent (not confirmed by parliament) dated thirtieth March, 11 Car. 1, granted to the University of Oxford, their old privileges are explained, and larger granted. 1 Mod. 161, Magdalen College case; Wood's Inst. 518..] [..Their courts are called the Chancellors' Courts. The chancellors are usually peers of the realm, and appointed over the whole university. But their courts are kept by their vice-chancellors, their assistants, or deputies: the causes are managed by advocates or proctors..][..These courts have jurisdiction in all causes ecclesiastical and civil (except mayhem, (a) felony, and freehold,) where a scholar, servant, or minister of the university is one of the parties in suit.</p>
