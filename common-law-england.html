    <h1>Common Law of England</h1>

    <h2>Magna Carta (1215) – The Foundation</h2>
    <blockquote>
        <p><strong>Clause 39</strong><br>
        No free man shall be seized or imprisoned, or stripped of his rights or possessions, or outlawed or exiled, or deprived of his standing in any way, nor will we proceed with force against him, or send others to do so, except by the lawful judgment of his equals or by the law of the land.</p>
        <p><strong>Clause 40</strong><br>
        To no one will we sell, to no one deny or delay right or justice.</p>
    </blockquote>

    <h2>Sir John Fortescue (c. 1394–1476)</h2>
    <blockquote>
        “The law of England is a law of mercy… it is called common law because it is common to all men.”
    </blockquote>

    <h2>Sir William Blackstone – Seven Pillars of Common Law</h2>
    <p>Blackstone’s <em>Commentaries on the Laws of England</em> (1765–1769) lists the absolute rights of individuals, protected by the common law:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>The right of personal security</li>
        <li>The right of personal liberty</li>
        <li>The right of private property</li>
        <li>The right to justice (due process)</li>
        <li>The right to arms for self-defense</li>
        <li>The right to petition and redress of grievances</li>
        <li>The right to trial by jury</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Common Law Is Discovered, Not Made</h2>
    <p>Sir Edward Coke: “The common law is the perfection of reason… it is an artificial perfection of reason, gotten by long study, observation, and experience.”</p>

    <h2>Jury as Judges of Both Law and Fact</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Lord Chief Justice Matthew Hale (1609–1676): “The jury are judges of the law as well as the fact when they are sworn.”</li>
        <li>Sir John Vaughan (1670): “The jury are the sole judges of the law in criminal cases.”</li>
        <li>Bushell’s Case (1670) – established that juries cannot be punished for their verdict (foundation of jury nullification)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Jury Nullification – Historical Examples</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1735 – John Peter Zenger acquitted of seditious libel (jury refused to enforce bad law)</li>
        <li>Pre-revolutionary America – juries routinely nullified British revenue laws</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Key Sources Quoted</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Sir John Fortescue – <em>De Laudibus Legum Angliae</em></li>
        <li>Henry de Bracton – <em>On the Laws and Customs of England</em> (c. 1235)</li>
        <li>Sir Christopher St. Germain – <em>The Doctor and Student</em> (1528)</li>
        <li>Sir Edward Coke – <em>Institutes of the Laws of England</em></li>
        <li>Sir Matthew Hale – <em>History of the Pleas of the Crown</em></li>
        <li>Sir William Blackstone – <em>Commentaries on the Laws of England</em></li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Carried Into America</h2>
    <p>The common law of England was adopted by every colony and became the foundation of American jurisprudence. The Seventh Amendment and many state constitutions preserve the right to trial by jury “according to the course of the common law.”</p>
